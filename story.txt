A group of college kids were driving across the country for spring break. While passing through Wyoming their car breaks down. With noone around for miles and no service, they decide to spend the night camping.
First, they decided to make a fire. As they had no ligter, they decided to use the gas in their car to make fire. However, they found that the gas in their car started to leak.

Since the students were out of options, they decided to head north in hopes of finding an oasis that would provide them with food and shelter. Eventually, they stumbled upon a cabin after traveling for 2 hours. They proceeded to spend the night there due to the graciousness of the homeowner, and safely continued their cross-country trip the next day.
